# HUMAN-EMOTION-ANALYSIS-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-TECHNIQUES.

## Project Overview
This project, titled **"Human Emotion Analysis Using Deep Learning Techniques,"** aims to recognize human emotions through facial expressions using advanced deep learning algorithms. The project was developed by **Buruju Sowmya** under the guidance of **Dr. Shubhangi Urkude** as part of the academic requirements at the Department of Computer Science & Technology, ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education.

## Project Description
The project involves the development of a system that can accurately detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions. The system utilizes various deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), to analyze and interpret facial features.

### Key Components
- **Face Detection**: Implemented using the Viola-Jones object detection framework.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and other feature extraction techniques.
- **Emotion Classification**: Employs SVMs and neural networks for classifying emotions into categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise.

## Software and Hardware Requirements
- **Software**: Python, Anaconda, PyCharm, OpenCV, NumPy
- **Hardware**: Computer with at least 4GB RAM, 150MB storage, and a webcam

## Implementation Details
The implementation is divided into several phases:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparation of the dataset, including normalization and augmentation.
2. **Model Training**: Training the deep learning models on the preprocessed dataset.
3. **Emotion Detection**: Real-time emotion detection using the trained models.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used for coding and implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Library for real-time computer vision.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library.
- **Anaconda**: Python distribution for scientific computing.

## Results
The system has been tested on various datasets and has shown promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency in recognizing emotions from facial expressions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in accurately recognizing human emotions from facial expressions, paving the way for more advanced and intuitive human-computer interactions.
